Milagro Reposado is a 100% blue agave tequila which is rested in American oak barrels for 2-4 months. Every sip of Milagro Reposado delivers delicious notes of warm caramel and vanilla, and ends with surprising � yet subtle � notes of spice.\nMilagro Reposado tequila is best enjoyed neat, on the rocks or used to create your new favorite cocktail � like the Paloma Rosada! A bright & fresh take on a traditional Paloma with Milagro Reposado.\nInspired by the upbeat energy and creativity of Mexico City, Milagro Tequila is hand-crafted in a process where tradition meets innovation. Our agave is sourced in the Jalisco Highlands, where the finest, sweetest blue agave in the world is cultivated. To extract all of the nuances of the precious agave flavor, the agave pi�as are slow-roasted for 36 hours in traditional brick ovens. The extracted juice is then fermented and is finally distilled twice: first, in a pot still to retain the vibrant and mouthwatering flavors of the agave and second, in a column still to impart an absolutely exquisite smoothness that compares to the finest white spirits in the world. \nPlease enjoy Milagro Tequila responsibly.","field4":"Milagro","field5":"57.99","field6":"0","field7":"6","field8":"1","field9":"","field10":"1","field11":"1","field12":"Milagro","field13":"1","field14":"Bottle","field15":"1.75","field16":"L","field17":"40","field18":"","field19":"Mexico","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"2022-02-02 17:21:27 -0500","field23":"2022-02-02 17:22:31 -0500","field24":"","field25":"","field26":"","field27":"mi-39967","field28":"","field29":"","field30":"","field31":"","field32":"0","field33":"0","field34":"*","field35":"","field36":"","field37":"Item manually added in retailer dashboard by catskillliquors@gmail.com","field38":"2022-02-02 17:21:27 -0500","field39":"Store Manager via DrizlyRetailer Add New Item","field40":"","field41":""}

Considered the paragon of Japanese whisky, Hibiki is a unique blend of several malt and grain whiskies that are meticulously added, resulting in an orchestra of aromas and flavors. \n\nHibiki is the�culmination of the Japanese art of blending and expert craftsmanship, with a healthy heaping of luxury thrown in for good measure. The brand was launched in 1989 to celebrate the brand Suntory's 90th birthday, and it's become Japan's most highly awarded blended whisky of all time. More than that, Hibiki takes the honor of being among the most prestigious whiskies the world over.\n\nHibiki Japanese Harmony Whisky is both delicate and luminous with a wonderful complexity. The amber-colored liquid smells of rosemary, rose, lychee and sandalwood, paving the way for a honey-like sweetness with notes of white chocolate and candied orange peel. As for the finish, Hibiki Japanese Haromy is subtle with a hint of Japanese oak, which lingers on the palate.\n\nIt�s best enjoyed neat, on the rocks or with a bit of water added. Japanese whisky pairs remarkably well with Japanese food, so don't be afraid to drink it with sashimi, sushi or a strong fermented fish. It also makes a wonderful cocktail, such as the Sokaiya, which consists of Hibiki, bitter Sencha green tea and ginger liqueur.\n\nBuy Hibiki Japanese Harmony Whisky online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.","field4":"Hibiki","field5":"110","field6":"0","field7":"0","field8":"1","field9":"","field10":"1","field11":"1","field12":"Hibiki","field13":"1","field14":"Bottle","field15":"750","field16":"ml","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"2021-11-25 11:12:10 -0500","field23":"2022-01-01 13:18:39 -0500","field24":"","field25":"","field26":"","field27":"mi-27335","field28":"","field29":"","field30":"","field31":"","field32":"0","field33":"0","field34":"*","field35":"","field36":"","field37":"Item manually added in retailer dashboard by catskillliquors@gmail.com","field38":"2021-11-25 11:12:10 -0500","field39":"Store Manager via DrizlyRetailer Add New Item","field40":"","field41":""}

Merlot, syrah, zinfandel, petite sirah and cabernet sauvignon collide in one bourbon barrel to create this dark and jammy wine, which features true bourbon flavor.

Bring this red blend along on your next picnic and enjoy it on its own, or stack this rich, bold taste up against lamb or poultry.

For almost a century, Cazadores has built its tequila empire on tradition, keeping its production and classic recipes a secret. In fact, as the legend goes, founder Don Jos� Maria perfected his recipe, wrote it down and then promptly locked it up in a box and hid it.\n\nSo what goes into each bottle of Cazadores Reposado? Today, the Cazadores distillery still takes a small-batch approach. Like all of Mexico's top-tier tequilas, Cazadores Reposado is made from 100 percent blue agave. First it's baked, then the agave leaves are shredded. After, the agave is double-fermented and double-distilled, according to the original recipe. As a reposado, it's aged in new oak casks prior to bottling.\n\nWhen you sip Cazadores Reposado, you'll get a taste of the Jalisco Highlands and smell the agave aroma. You'll also notice warm tasting notes, including baked pear, cinnamon and vanilla. The hint of white pepper adds some spice to this tequila, and the oaky notes keep it down to earth.\n\nHow can you enjoy Cazadores Reposado to the fullest? This smooth tequila is great for drinking straight, as its flavor is complex enough for sipping. If you're going for neat, keep in mind that Cazadores Reposado is best served chilled. Lighten up this reposado by pairing it with lemon-lime soda or mix Cazadores Reposado into tequila drinks such as tequila smashes or tequila fizzes.\n\nBuy Cazadores Reposado online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.","field4":"Cazadores","field5":"42.99","field6":"0","field7":"3","field8":"1","field9":"","field10":"1","field11":"1","field12":"Cazadores","field13":"1","field14":"Bottle","field15":"1.75","field16":"L","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"2021-05-23 15:21:19 -0400","field23":"2022-01-01 14:52:38 -0500","field24":"","field25":"","field26":"","field27":"mi-19452","field28":"","field29":"","field30":"","field31":"","field32":"0","field33":"0","field34":"*Tequila*Liquor*Type*Liquor A - C*4 Cazadores*Liquor","field35":"","field36":"","field37":"Item manually added in retailer dashboard by catskillliquors@gmail.com","field38":"2021-05-23 15:21:19 -0400","field39":"Store Manager via DrizlyRetailer Add New Item","field40":"","field41":""}

On the rocks, by the shot, at times, straight from the bottle. Tequila-filled nights with friends is how Casamigos was born. \n�Our idea was to make the best-tasting, smoothest Tequila and Mezcal that didn�t have to be covered up with salt or lime. So we did.�\n-George Clooney and Rande Gerber\n\nCasamigos, a small batch, ultra-premium tequila made from the finest, hand-selected 100% Blue Weber agaves, grown in the rich red clay and cool climate of the Highlands of Jalisco, Mexico for a minimum of seven years. After harvest, the agave pi�as are roasted in traditional brick ovens for 72 hours, before undergoing an extra-slow fermentation process over an additional eighty hours, nearly double the industry standard. \n\nCasamigos Reposado is aged for 7 months.

On the rocks, by the shot, at times, straight from the bottle. Tequila-filled nights with friends is how Casamigos was born. \n�Our idea was to make the best-tasting, smoothest Tequila and Mezcal that didn�t have to be covered up with salt or lime. So we did.�\n-George Clooney and Rande Gerber\n\nCasamigos, a small batch, ultra-premium tequila made from the finest, hand-selected 100% Blue Weber agaves, grown in the rich red clay and cool climate of the Highlands of Jalisco, Mexico for a minimum of seven years. After harvest, the agave pi�as are roasted in traditional brick ovens for 72 hours, before undergoing an extra-slow fermentation process over an additional eighty hours, nearly double the industry standard.\n\nCasamigos A�ejo is aged for 14 months. It has a pure and complex aroma, with soft caramel and vanilla notes. Perfect balance of sweetness from the Blue Weber agaves, with subtle hints of spice and barrel oak, with a lingering smooth finish.\n\nCasamigos A�ejo is enjoyed best neat or on the rocks. For one looking for a new take on a classic cocktail try the Casamigos Old Fashioned. In a mixing glass over ice mix 1.75 oz Casamigos A�ejo Tequila, .25 oz vanilla syrup, 3 drops of lemon bitters. Stir all ingredients together and then strain into a large rocks glass with the ice of your choice. Garnish with an orange peel.\n\nBuy Casamigos A�ejo online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.","field4":"Casamigos","field5":"132.99","field6":"0","field7":"0","field8":"1","field9":"","field10":"1","field11":"1","field12":"Casamigos","field13":"1","field14":"Bottle","field15":"1.75","field16":"L","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"2021-05-23 14:59:27 -0400","field23":"2022-01-01 15:00:57 -0500","field24":"","field25":"","field26":"","field27":"mi-92508","field28":"","field29":"","field30":"","field31":"","field32":"0","field33":"0","field34":"*","field35":"","field36":"","field37":"Item manually added in retailer dashboard by catskillliquors@gmail.com","field38":"2021-05-23 14:59:27 -0400","field39":"Store Manager via DrizlyRetailer Add New Item","field40":"","field41":""}

This red blend is characterized by cherry and red berry fruit notes with delicately spiced hints of tobacco, leather, cedar, white pepper and a touch of flint. Featuring velvety tannins, firm acidity and a lingering finish of rosemary, this chianti wine is well balanced on the palate. Each bottle of this Ruffino wine is made with a careful selection of the best grapes from the traditional Chianti Classico production region.

At the age of sixteen, he started work in the Distillery as an office boy and fast became a leading pioneer in the development of bourbon. From the time he was made company president in 1921 until his retirement in 1952, his Distillery expanded from 44 to 144 buildings to become the largest Distillery of its day. During that period Colonel Blanton created his very special and limited supply of bourbon - his private reserve - handpicked and stored in what now is known as the famous Warehouse H. Although Colonel Blanton died in the spring of 1959, his legacy lives. Introduced in 1984, Blanton�s namesake bourbon was the first ever Single Barrel Bourbon sold commercially. The Single Barrel Bourbon is the first of its kind.\n\nBlanton's is the Original Single Barrel Bourbon that retains its uniqueness today by virtue of world wide critical acclaim. It has been awarded international gold medals, grand gold medals, and recommendations from noted spirits writers like Paul Pacult. The individual barrel selection process is one that involves one of the most respected Master Distillers in the bourbon industry. Elmer T. Lee introduced Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon in 1984 and since that time has been enshrined in the Master Distillers' Hall of Fame. Elmer searched the honey spots of Warehouse H to personally select those barrels destined for greatness. Unlike other brands which are restricted to certain ages, Blanton's strives for a distinctive flavor profile across an array of years. The typical bourbon used is approximately eight years old, however, it is not unusual for the age to extend to ten or twelve years. From world-class bourbon to the most unique package, everything about Blanton's exudes quality, class, and excellence.\n\nREVIEWS\n\"Liquid gold.\"\n�Jim Murray's Whisky Bible\n\nTASTING NOTES\nA deep, satisfying nose of nutmeg and spices.

Bill Samuels bought the Burks' Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, in 1953 and did the predictable ��just not in a predictable way.\n\nHe wanted to select the right mashbill for his new Bourbon. He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.\n\nNo rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.\n\nThe result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.\n\nThis collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.\n\nIf you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks. There's a navel with some extra fuzz.\n\nFor your home bar (depending on your budget and the height of your top shelf) Maker's Mark makes a fine everyday house bourbon or a special occasion sipper to put next to your best bottles from Scotland, Ireland and Japan. Buy Maker�s Mark Whisky online at a great price on Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.","field4":"Maker's Mark","field5":"37.99","field6":"0","field7":"6","field8":"1","field9":"","field10":"1","field11":"1","field12":"Maker's Mark","field13":"1","field14":"Bottle","field15":"750","field16":"ml","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"2021-01-29 19:41:21 -0500","field23":"2022-01-29 14:33:42 -0500","field24":"","field25":"","field26":"","field27":"mi-165709","field28":"","field29":"","field30":"","field31":"","field32":"0","field33":"0","field34":"*","field35":"","field36":"","field37":"Item manually added in retailer dashboard by catskillliquors@gmail.com","field38":"2021-01-29 19:41:21 -0500","field39":"Store Manager via DrizlyRetailer Add New Item","field40":"","field41":""}

Our 86 proof whisky has the intense, full-bodied flavor reminiscent of a driftwood fire at dusk. The taste of dry peat smoke with strong maritime notes results in a complex dram that is complemented by a long, elegant finish. Distilled in Lagavulin, Scotland on the coast of Islay, centuries of local distilling excellence has earned our whisky the Double Gold Medal at the 2017 San Francisco World Spirits Competition. Our aging process in oak casks gives our whisky the extraordinary and classic smoky flavor that demands to be served in a traditional whisky glass, neat or with a little water.\n\n Carrying on a 200-year-old tradition of distilling excellence, the Lagavulin distillery is said to be one of the oldest distilleries on Islay. Founded in 1816 by farmer John Johnston and later led by Peter Mackies in 1887, the name Lagavulin was to become the last word on the delicacy of Islay malts.

Our limited edition 96 proof whisky has the intense, full-bodied flavor of charred, minty dark chocolate. The lingering tastes flow into a clean, long finish. Distilled in Lagavulin, Scotland on the coast of Islay, centuries of local distilling tradition are what make our malts so unique. Our aging process in oak casks gives our whisky the extraordinary and classic smoky flavor that demand to be served in a whisky nosing glass, neat or with a little water.\n\nCarrying on a 200-year-old tradition of distilling excellence, the Lagavulin distillery is said to be one of the oldest distilleries on Islay. Founded in 1816 by farmer John Johnston and later led by Peter Mackies in 1887, the name Lagavulin was to become the last word on the delicacy of Islay malts. Miles and miles of peat bog in the west of the island provide the raw material which imbues the barley with our iconic smoky flavor, and the rich peaty water that runs from the Solan Lochs into the distillery makes the flavors so unique.

To achieve it, they practiced ritual drinking of beverages made from agave. Such drinks were exclusively for religious ceremonies and for the spiritual elite. The gods of the drinks were called collectively centzon totochtin (400 rabbits) in Nahuatl. The number 400 was synonymous with �innumerable� and� uncountable�. It is believed that the spirit of the 400 rabbits carries on to this day in each bottle of this fine mezcal.\n\nThe best agaves are selected after cultivation and cooked in traditional cone-shaped wood ovens. The wood is lit and volcanic rocks are placed on top of it in a pyramid shape. Finally, the oven is covered with cloth and earth and cooked for 3-5 days. Once cooked, the pi�as are milled with a stone and kept in a wooden tub for fermentation. 400 Conejos Joven is double distilled and bottled to enjoy at 80 proof.","field4":"400 Conejos Mezcal","field5":"41.99","field6":"0","field7":"6","field8":"1","field9":"","field10":"1","field11":"1","field12":"400 Conejos Mezcal","field13":"1","field14":"Bottle","field15":"750","field16":"ml","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"2020-11-29 12:35:15 -0500","field23":"2022-01-15 16:26:52 -0500","field24":"","field25":"","field26":"","field27":"mi-229162","field28":"","field29":"","field30":"","field31":"","field32":"0","field33":"0","field34":"*","field35":"","field36":"","field37":"Item manually added in retailer dashboard by catskillliquors@gmail.com","field38":"2020-11-29 12:35:15 -0500","field39":"Store Manager via DrizlyRetailer Add New Item","field40":"","field41":""}

The richness and vibrancy combine with fruity aromas and mellow vanilla, making it perfect for mixed drinks and cocktails. \n\nMonkey Shoulder casks are former bourbon casks, which add smooth vanilla flavors to this Scotch. It also has no grain whisky whatsoever anywhere in or even near the drink. It's barley all the way, folks.\n\nThe name Monkey Shoulder might sound funny, but it has a history in whisky making. The maltmen who used to turn the barley would take long shifts, using their dominant arm significantly while working. At the end, their shoulders would droop on one side, an ailment that became known as \"Monkey Shoulder.\" Today, nobody working at Monkey Shoulder actually has the affliction, though the barley still gets turned by hand. Working conditions are much better than they used to be. The name sounds cool and harkens back to the old whisky making days.\n\nMonkey Shoulder tastes delicious neat, with a splash of water, and on the rocks. It stands out in mixed drinks, too, given its orange and vanilla flavors with a bit of spice. Try it in a Rob Roy or a Blood and Sand to impress your palate and your friends.\n\nBuy Monkey Shoulder Blended Scotch online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.","field4":"","field5":"61.99","field6":"0","field7":"6","field8":"1","field9":"","field10":"1","field11":"1","field12":"","field13":"1","field14":"Bottle","field15":"1.75","field16":"L","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"2020-11-29 12:30:03 -0500","field23":"2022-01-15 16:27:51 -0500","field24":"","field25":"","field26":"","field27":"mi-227209","field28":"","field29":"","field30":"","field31":"","field32":"0","field33":"0","field34":"*","field35":"","field36":"","field37":"Item manually added in retailer dashboard by catskillliquors@gmail.com","field38":"2020-11-29 12:30:03 -0500","field39":"Store Manager via DrizlyRetailer Add New Item","field40":"","field41":""},
